## Overview

This is a PoC wallet for Decred cryptocurrency. It is supposed to lay the groundwork for future wallet development.
It solves the hardest problems of configuring and creating encrypted connections to Decred wallet and Decred blockchain processes.
It also provides couple examples of async RPC API calls which show how to access the Decred blockchain API. One could use these examples to implement
GUI on top of the API. The result would be fully featured Decred GUI wallet. The current GUI code is a placeholder.
